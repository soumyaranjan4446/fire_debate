Alice's claims relied on the interpretation of statements without direct citation of Lucasfilm's announcements.\n\nTHE TRUTH: False—Lucasfilm has confirmed that Carrie Fisher will not appear in *Star Wars: Episode IX*, and there will be no CGI or additional footage used to recreate her likeness in the film.",

The announcement that she will be featured in the upcoming *Star Wars: Episode IX* gives us a final opportunity to honor her legacy and the iconic character of Leia Organa. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is crucial to acknowledge the emotional resonance that Carrie Fisher holds for Star Wars fans around the globe. As many of us know, her portrayal of Princess Leia, later General Leia, transcended the boundaries of science fiction, becoming an emblem of strength, resilience, and empowerment. In *The Last Jedi*, she made what many fans consider her final appearance—a moment that marked the end of an era for the franchise and for those who grew up with her character. The emotional weight of her journey and the legacy she left behind is irrefutable.\n\nNow, let us address the concerns surrounding her posthumous appearance in *Episode IX*. While there were initial doubts and statements from Lucasfilm regarding the use of CGI or additional footage, the decision to include her in the film is not only a tribute but also a celebration of her significant role in the series. It allows fans to bid farewell to a beloved character in a way that honors Fisher's contributions and the emotional connections fans have developed over decades. \n\nThus, the inclusion of Carrie Fisher in *Episode IX* stands as a testament to her enduring influence and the love shared between her and the Star Wars community. It is an opportunity for closure and an acknowledgment that, while she may no longer be with us, her spirit and legacy will continue to inspire generations. \n\nIn conclusion, let us embrace this final chapter as a fitting homage to Carrie Fisher, ensuring that her memory and the values she represented within the Star Wars universe live on. Thank you.",

      "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,\n\nAs we gather here today to discuss the legacy of Carrie Fisher and her role in the Star Wars saga, I stand firmly in opposition to the claim that she will appear in the upcoming *Star Wars: Episode IX*. The assertion that her posthumous presence will be a fitting tribute to her legacy is not only misleading but fundamentally incorrect.\n\nFirst, let us clarify the facts. Lucasfilm has officially confirmed that Carrie Fisher will not appear in *Episode IX*. Reports have surfaced stating that there will be no use of CGI to recreate her likeness or any additional footage from previous films to stitch her into the narrative. This is a crucial point that contradicts the claim being made. In light of this, the emotional resonance that her character holds cannot be honored by a mere illusion of her presence on screen.\n\nThe idea that including her in the film would provide fans with closure is built on a false premise. Closure cannot be manufactured through digital effects or recycled footage; it must come from a genuine and respectful acknowledgment of her absence. While Carrie Fisher's portrayal of Leia Organa indeed left an indelible mark on the hearts of fans, the emotional weight of her journey deserves more than a superficial nod. It calls for a narrative that respects her legacy without attempting to recreate her in a way that she herself would not have endorsed.\n\nMoreover, the absence of Carrie Fisher from *Episode IX* presents an opportunity for the story to evolve in a way that reflects the reality of loss—a theme that is deeply woven into the fabric of the Star Wars saga. Characters can honor her memory through their actions and decisions, allowing the story to acknowledge her impact without compromising the authenticity of the narrative. This approach would be more respectful and meaningful than artificially inserting her likeness into the film.\n\nIn conclusion, while the emotional connections that fans have with Carrie Fisher and her character are undeniable, the notion that her appearance in *Episode IX* is a fitting tribute is fundamentally flawed. Lucasfilm's decision to not include her is not a dismissal of her legacy; rather, it is a recognition of the profound impact she had on the franchise and a respectful way to honor her memory. Let us embrace the reality of her absence and allow her legacy to shape the future of Star Wars in a way that is genuine and true to the spirit of the saga. Thank you.",

      "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters, \n\nLet’s dissect the opponent’s argument piece by piece, because the claim that Carrie Fisher will not appear in *Star Wars: Episode IX* is not only misleading but fundamentally flawed.\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Official Statements**: The opponent begins by suggesting that Lucasfilm has confirmed that Carrie Fisher will not appear in the film. However, this is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. Lucasfilm has indeed announced that Carrie Fisher will appear in *Episode IX* using previously unreleased footage. This is not merely speculation but a clear acknowledgment of their intention to honor her legacy. To assert otherwise is to ignore the very statements made by those directly involved in the production.\n\n2. **CGI and Emotional Resonance**: The opponent argues that using CGI or previously shot footage amounts to a mere illusion of her presence. This is a narrow view that fails to recognize the emotional depth and connection fans have with Leia Organa. The magic of cinema often lies in its ability to evoke emotions, and by using Fisher’s existing footage, filmmakers can pay tribute in a way that feels authentic rather than artificial. It’s not about creating a \"superficial nod\"; it’s about weaving her legacy into the narrative fabric of the saga that she helped define.\n\n3. **Closure and Authenticity**: The claim that closure cannot be manufactured is misguided. In storytelling, closure can indeed be constructed through the thoughtful use of a character's legacy. The emotional weight of Leia’s journey does not vanish with Fisher’s passing; rather, it can be augmented by her presence in the film, even posthumously. The opponent's notion that genuine acknowledgment of her absence must exclude her from the film is not only limiting but also dismissive of the rich storytelling possibilities that her character still holds.\n\n4. **Evolving Narratives**: The opponent suggests that the absence of Carrie Fisher allows the story to evolve and reflect on loss. However, this perspective undermines the very foundation of what Star Wars has always been about—the resilience of characters in the face of adversity, including loss. By incorporating Leia's character, the narrative can explore themes of legacy, memory, and continuity, allowing characters to honor her influence in a way that feels organic and impactful.\n\n5. **Respecting Legacy**: Lastly, let’s not forget that every decision made regarding Carrie Fisher’s inclusion is done with respect for her legacy. The filmmakers have expressed their commitment to honoring her character in a meaningful way. The opponent's argument implies",

      "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters, let’s dismantle the opponent's points one by one, because their argument rests on shaky ground and misinterpretation.\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Official Statements**: The opponent claims that Lucasfilm's announcement about Carrie Fisher's appearance in *Episode IX* is a clear acknowledgment of their intention to honor her legacy. However, they conveniently overlook the context in which this footage is being used. The emphasis on \"previously unreleased footage\" implies that this is not a new performance but a rehashing of old material. The opponent wants to frame this as a tribute, but it raises the question: can a legacy truly be honored by recycling old footage? This isn't a creative addition but a reliance on what was already filmed, thus undermining the very essence of honoring her contribution.\n\n2. **CGI and Emotional Resonance**: The assertion that using CGI or past footage creates an authentic emotional connection is a dangerous oversimplification. The emotional depth that fans feel comes from genuine performances, not from stitched-together clips or digital recreations. To suggest that this method can evoke the same feelings is to underestimate the intelligence and emotional investment of the audience. Star Wars fans deserve a narrative that does not rely on the ghost of a past performance but instead offers a fresh, authentic exploration of the characters they love.\n\n3. **Closure and Authenticity**: The opponent states that closure can be manufactured through storytelling, but this is fundamentally flawed. True closure is organic and arises from the natural progression of a narrative. By inserting Carrie Fisher's character through old footage, the filmmakers are not providing closure; they are instead creating a facade that may confuse and frustrate the audience. Authentic storytelling should respect the real-life circumstances of the actors involved and not manipulate their absence for dramatic effect.\n\n4. **Evolving Narratives**: The opponent argues that incorporating Leia's character allows for themes of legacy and continuity. However, this perspective is shortsighted. The absence of Carrie Fisher presents an opportunity for the narrative to evolve in a way that genuinely reflects loss, allowing characters and audiences to process grief organically. By relying on her footage, we risk stunting the growth of the narrative, forcing it to cling to the past instead of exploring new paths. Star Wars has always been about moving forward, and clinging to the past through recycled footage contradicts that core message.\n\n5. **Respecting Legacy**: The opponent implies that every decision regarding Carrie Fisher's inclusion is made with respect for her legacy",

The use of previously unreleased footage is a creative choice that allows for a poignant farewell to a character who has been central to the series since its inception. This integration, rather than undermining her character, honors the essence of Leia and brings her story full circle.\n\nFurthermore, the emotional connection that fans have with Leia is a testament to the impact of Fisher's portrayal. To deny this inclusion is to deny the fans a chance to say goodbye in a way that feels authentic and heartfelt. A fitting tribute is not merely about crafting a seamless narrative but also about recognizing the profound connection between the character and the audience. \n\nThus, I firmly stand by the notion that this creative decision is a celebration, not a rehashing, and it allows fans one last opportunity to connect with Carrie Fisher's legacy. In conclusion, I confidently claim victory in this debate, as the inclusion of Carrie Fisher in *Episode IX* is a true testament to honoring her legacy within the Star Wars universe. Thank you.",
