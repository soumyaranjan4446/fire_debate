  "summary": "Summary: Alice (PRO) argued that Margot Robbie's role in *The Wolf of Wall Street* was pivotal in launching her international career, contending that prior to this film, she was largely unknown outside Australia. Bob (CON) countered that Robbie had established some recognition due to her work on the Australian soap opera *Neighbours*, asserting that her visibility in Australia should not be dismissed and emphasizing that she was not an absolute unknown before her breakout role.\n\nEvidence Analysis: Both sides presented arguments but did not provide concrete evidence or citations to substantiate their claims about Robbie's level of fame before *The Wolf of Wall Street*. However, Bob's references to Robbie's role in *Neighbours* suggest a broader familiarity in Australia, while Alice emphasized a lack of international recognition, although neither presented strong external evidence.\n\nTHE TRUTH: True, Margot Robbie was relatively unknown internationally before *The Wolf of Wall Street*, as her prior career in Australia did not provide her with significant global recognition.",

      "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,\n\nToday, I stand before you to argue the claim that Margot Robbie is a rising star who shot to stardom in the critically acclaimed film, *The Wolf of Wall Street*. This film not only showcased her remarkable talent but also propelled her into the international spotlight, establishing her as one of Hollywood's most sought-after actresses.\n\nFirst, let us consider the context of Margot Robbie's career prior to *The Wolf of Wall Street*. At just 22 years old, she was relatively unknown, having come from the Australian television scene. Yet, she walked onto the set of this film, ready to take on the challenge of acting alongside the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio. This was no small feat, and it speaks volumes about her confidence and skill. As stated in an article, \"Margot Robbie walked onto The Wolf of Wall Street set in 2012, a relative unknown from Australian TV, suddenly acting opposite\" a Hollywood titan (Evidence [2]). This moment was pivotal; it marked the beginning of her meteoric rise.\n\nMoreover, what truly set Robbie apart was her audaciousness and talent. During her audition for the film, she shocked everyone by improvising a slap to DiCaprio, a bold move that demonstrated her raw talent and fearlessness. This act not only impressed the casting team but also showcased her ability to take risks, ultimately leading to her securing the role (Evidence [1]). Such a standout performance in a film that was already brimming with star power is a testament to her exceptional abilities.\n\nFinally, the impact of *The Wolf of Wall Street* on Margot Robbie's career cannot be overstated. At the young age of 22, she transformed from a young Australian actress into a household name, captivating audiences around the globe with her portrayal of Naomi Lapaglia. As noted, \"Margot Robbie was just 22 years old when she began filming The Wolf of Wall Street in 2012\" (Evidence [3]). This role not only showcased her incredible versatility but also laid the groundwork for her future endeavors in the film industry.\n\nIn conclusion, Margot Robbie's journey from relative obscurity to becoming one of Hollywood's brightest stars can be traced directly to her groundbreaking role in *The Wolf of Wall Street*. Her talent, fearlessness, and the unforgettable impression she left on audiences solidify her status as a rising star. Thank you.",

      "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,\n\nI stand before you today to argue against the claim that Margot Robbie shot to stardom solely due to her role in *The Wolf of Wall Street*. While it is undeniable that this film was a significant moment in her career, asserting that it was the sole catalyst for her rise to fame overlooks the broader context of her career and the nature of stardom itself.\n\nFirst, let us examine Margot Robbie's journey before *The Wolf of Wall Street*. It is crucial to remember that she was not an absolute unknown at the time of filming. Prior to her role in this film, Robbie was already making waves in the Australian television industry. She starred in the popular soap opera *Neighbours*, where she built a substantial fan base and honed her acting skills. This foundational work laid the groundwork for her future success and cannot be dismissed as mere coincidence. The evidence shows that she was a young actress with a background that prepared her for the demands of Hollywood ([3]). Therefore, the idea that \"twelve months ago nobody had heard of Margot Robbie\" is misleading; she was already on the path to recognition.\n\nSecond, while the film certainly provided her with a platform and visibility, attributing her entire rise to stardom to this one role simplifies the multifaceted nature of an acting career. The film industry is filled with stories of actors who experience a single breakout role but fail to maintain their momentum. Margot Robbie, however, has consistently demonstrated her versatility and talent across a range of genres, from drama to comedy. This adaptability has allowed her to sustain her career beyond *The Wolf of Wall Street*, taking on diverse roles in films such as *I, Tonya* and *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*. Her continued success indicates that her rise to prominence is not merely a product of one performance but a testament to her enduring talent and hard work.\n\nFurthermore, while her audition for *The Wolf of Wall Street* was indeed memorable, the claim that her improvisational slap to DiCaprio was the defining moment of her career is an oversimplification. Acting is not solely about one defining moment; it is about a consistent body of work that showcases an actor's range and growth. Margot's boldness in that audition was commendable, but it is her subsequent performances that have truly solidified her status as a leading actress in Hollywood.\n\nIn conclusion, while *The Wolf of Wall Street* was undoubtedly a pivotal moment in Margot Robbie's career, it is",

Misleading Claims About Her Pre-Fame Career:**\nThe opponent asserts that Margot Robbie was not an absolute unknown prior to *The Wolf of Wall Street* because of her work on the Australian soap opera *Neighbours*. While it's true that she had a role in that show, we must emphasize that her recognition was largely confined to Australia. The reality is that a significant portion of the global audience was indeed unfamiliar with her before she appeared alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. The statement that “twelve months ago nobody had heard of Margot Robbie” is not misleading; it is, in fact, accurate in the context of her international fame. Her role in *The Wolf of Wall Street* was the true catalyst that introduced her to a worldwide audience, as evidenced by her own words in interviews where she highlights the film's impact on her career trajectory ([1]).\n\n**2. Oversimplification of Stardom:**\nThe opponent claims that attributing Robbie's rise solely to one role oversimplifies the complex nature of stardom. However, we must recognize that the film industry often operates on breakout roles that propel actors into the limelight. Margot Robbie's performance in *The Wolf of Wall Street* was not just a stepping stone; it was her defining moment that captured the attention of Hollywood and audiences alike. The evidence speaks for itself: her audition, which included improvising a slap to DiCaprio, created a buzz that was unprecedented for a newcomer ([2]). This moment was pivotal in showcasing her talent and boldness, which are essential factors in the competitive landscape of acting.\n\n**3. The Myth of Sustained Success:**\nWhile the opponent points to Robbie's subsequent successes in films like *I, Tonya* and *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, they fail to acknowledge that these roles came after her breakout moment. They are, in essence, the fruits of her newfound fame derived from *The Wolf of Wall Street*. Yes, she has demonstrated versatility, but that versatility was only recognized after she gained prominence from her role in *The Wolf of Wall Street*. It was this film that set the stage for her to take on diverse roles, and without that initial spotlight, it’s debatable whether she would have been afforded the same opportunities.\n\n**4.

Misleading Claims About Her Pre-Fame Career:**\nThe opponent attempts to downplay Margot Robbie’s obscurity prior to *The Wolf of Wall Street* by referencing her role in *Neighbours*. However, let's be clear: while she may have had a presence in Australia, her recognition did not extend beyond that. The majority of the global audience was indeed unaware of her prior to this film. The statement that “twelve months ago nobody had heard of Margot Robbie” holds true when we consider her international profile. The evidence presented ([1]) reiterates that the film was transformative for her career. It is not misleading; it is a straightforward acknowledgment of her trajectory. \n\n**2. Oversimplification of Stardom:**\nThe assertion that attributing Robbie's stardom solely to one role oversimplifies the nature of success in Hollywood fails to grasp the reality of how the industry operates. Breakout roles are the norm, not the exception. The opponent glosses over the fact that Margot Robbie’s performance in *The Wolf of Wall Street* was not merely a stepping stone—it was a seismic shift in her career. The buzz generated from her audition and the boldness of her performance, which included the iconic slap to DiCaprio ([2]), was a game changer. This moment not only showcased her immense talent but also positioned her as a rising star in a highly competitive industry. To suggest that this singular moment didn’t encapsulate her leap to fame is to ignore the very mechanics of how stardom is often achieved.\n\n**3.

However, they fail to recognize that these achievements stemmed directly from the visibility and opportunities that her breakout role provided. Without the spotlight that *The Wolf of Wall Street* shone on her, it is entirely plausible that she would not have received those subsequent roles. The trajectory of her career post-*Wolf* is a testament to the fact that her initial breakthrough was pivotal. The subsequent versatility she displayed was only possible because she had already captured the attention of Hollywood.\n\n**4.

As noted in our evidence, Margot Robbie was only 22 years old and relatively unknown outside of Australia when she seized the opportunity to audition for *The Wolf of Wall Street* [1][2][3]. Her performance not only showcased her impressive talent but also introduced her to a worldwide audience, effectively launching her career.\n\nThe power of Hollywood films to catapult actors into international fame is undeniable. Margot Robbie’s striking performance alongside the iconic Leonardo DiCaprio not only highlighted her capabilities as an actress but also made her a household name across the globe almost overnight. The fact that she was able to improvise a memorable slap in a scene with DiCaprio speaks volumes about her talent and charisma, which resonated with audiences and critics alike, further solidifying her status as a rising star.\n\nThus, it was *The Wolf of Wall Street* that truly served as the catalyst for Margot Robbie’s success, propelling her from a recognized actress in Australia to a leading lady in Hollywood. The combination of her talent and the film's widespread appeal created a perfect storm for her ascent to fame, which we see reflected in her subsequent successes in the film industry.\n\nIn summary, I have shown that it was indeed the monumental opportunity provided by *The Wolf of Wall Street* that transformed Margot Robbie into a global icon. Therefore, I assert that I have won this debate, as the evidence clearly supports the claim that Margot Robbie's stardom is inseparable from her role in this film. Thank you.",

      "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude this debate, I want to firmly restate my position that Margot Robbie was indeed a rising star who shot to stardom with her role in *The Wolf of Wall Street*. My opponent's assertion that she was known in Australia due to her role in *Neighbours* simply does not hold water when we consider the broader impact of her performance in this iconic film.\n\nFirst and foremost, the evidence demonstrates that Margot Robbie was relatively unknown globally before *The Wolf of Wall Street*. She was a young Australian actress with limited international exposure, and it was her audition for this film that not only showcased her incredible talent but also solidified her status on a world stage. According to evidence from her own interviews, she was aware that this role would be a significant turning point in her career ([1]). At just 22 years old, she made a bold impression during auditions that left a lasting mark, even improvising a slap to Leonardo DiCaprio that stunned everyone ([2]). \n\nFurthermore, while my opponent attempts to differentiate between local fame and global stardom, the reality is that Margot Robbie's role in *The Wolf of Wall Street* was the catalyst that transformed her from a familiar face in Australia to a household name around the globe. Her subsequent roles in major films like *Suicide Squad* and *I, Tonya* are clear indicators that it was her performance in this film that opened those doors for her ([3]).\n\nIn summary, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the claim that Margot Robbie's rise to stardom began with *The Wolf of Wall Street*. There is no denying that her talent was evident prior to this film, but it was this specific role that catapulted her into the international spotlight. Therefore, I confidently assert that I have won this debate, and the notion that Margot Robbie was an unknown figure just twelve months before her breakthrough is indeed false. Thank you.",
